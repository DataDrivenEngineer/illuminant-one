Illuminant Technical Interview - Take-Home Problem:

Included in this .zip file are 2 images (1920x1080p) of a patient's back in PNG format: one in grayscale, and another in color.
10 circular/donut-shaped stickers have been placed in the middle the patient's back, along with some different stickers that we aren't currently interested in further up the patient's back in rgb.png and gray.png You may choose either or both images to work with if you'd like. The challenge is to find the 2D coordinates (in image pixels) of the centers of these round stickers. e.g.:

"
112,115
730, 32
1503, 996
...
"

You may print the results directly to the console, out to a text file, in .csv format, printed onto the image, or any other sensible way - whichever is easiest (drawing the found centers over the original image is probably ideal).

There is no time limit but, please do not spend too long on this task. Get as far as you're able and then plan out the remainder of your solution to be reviewed in the interview.

You may use either C/C++ or C# and any additional libraries or plugins. I recommend OpenCV.

1. Set up your development environment, and save your work in a Git/GitHub repository, making sensible commits as you progress.
2. Install/import any useful libraries that you may need.
3. Try to read the image into memory and display it back (you can convert it to any format you like beforehand.)
4. Try to find at least one of the circles, and maybe some false positives.
5. Try to get as many of the circles with maybe some false positives.
6. Try to eliminate false positives.

If incomplete, please be prepared to describe a potential method/plan to solve the remaining steps. Try not to spend too long on this problem! The majority of candidates take a few hours at most.
